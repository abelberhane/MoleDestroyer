# MoleDestroyer

Windows Form Game made entirely in C#. The game was not too difficult to make and I wrote a fair amount of comments to explain the 
reasoning behind some of the decisions. 

The logic behind randomly moving it to one of the 6 slots made sense and I was able to effectively count the hits and misses.
